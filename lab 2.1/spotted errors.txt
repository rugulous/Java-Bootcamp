"Public" should be "public"
"Glass" should be "class"
"My Addition Programme" should not have spaces ("MyAdditionProgramme")
The braces to start and end the class are not the same ("[" and "}") - should both be curly braces. Same issue with "avoid mine"
"pub" should be "public"
"status" should be "static"
"avoid" should be "void"
"mine" should be "main"
"string()" is invalid syntax - to define it as an array it should be "string[]"
quote mismatch within System.out.println - uses 3 different types of quotation marks (only 1 is actually recognised). All of these should be the same
adding string and int could lead to unexpected output
